# SHA-256 Visualizer

![SHA-256 Visualizer](public/thumbnail.png)

**An animated, step-by-step visualizer for SHA-256.**

A tool that lets you watch SHA-256 execute in real-time. Every phase is animated:

- Padding
- Message schedule
- 64 compression rounds
- Final hash

Step forward, step back, autoplay, or jump to any phase. Everything shown in actual binary.

Most SHA-256 resources are either dense specs or vague overviews. This tool lets you actually *see* the bits move:

- Rotations that visually wrap around
- XOR operations combining values bit by bit
- State updates showing what changes each round vs. what just shifts

**Limitations:** Currently supports messages up to 55 characters (single block) and SHA-256 only. Multi-block hashing and other algorithms (SHA-1, SHA-512, RIPEMD-160, etc.) can be added if there's interest.
